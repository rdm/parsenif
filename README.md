Some J doodles to eventually work with bethesda nifs

See also:

    https://github.com/rdm/nifxml local clone of nif.xml
    https://github.com/rdm/nifty an earlier draft that I'll probably pull some ideas from
    https://github.com/rdm/nifskope a clone of the the official nif application
    https://github.com/rdm/niflib a clone of the official api for nif.xml and *.nif files

Note that by "official" I mean "in the context of nif.xml", which is an artifact produced by some talented members of the game modding community.

*.nif files are really game asset files and thus the "true official support" would be the games and modding tools that use them (or, at least, the games which are distributed with some history of official approval for and support of a modding community).

Since I'm focusing on Bethesda games, that mostly means these kinds of nifs (and other modding tools):

    Fallout 4 (+ Creation Kit)
    Skyrim (+ Creation Kit)
    Fallout 3 (+ GECK)
    Oblivion (+ Construction Set)
    Morrowind (+ TES:CS)
